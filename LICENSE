## ✅ First Tools to Add (Based on What You Work On)

Would you like me to generate a first sample project in the `examples/` folder, like a FastAPI + YOLO WebSocket setup or a LangChain chat endpoint?

Let me know if you want a GitHub-ready repo scaffold zipped or if you want to start coding it here directly.
